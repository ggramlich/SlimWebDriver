The http://localhost:${FITNESSE_PORT}/files/ page contains a div with css class sidebar which contains the anchor tag with text !-FrontPage-!

We can use the <WebDriver ''find element'' method and Slim's ''push fixture'' and ''pop fixture'' methods directly.
The ''By'' locators are written down like this:
'''method:selector value'''

Where method is one of
 * class name
 * css selector
 * id
 * link text
 * partial link text
 * name
 * tag name
 * xpath

!|script         |slim web driver       |${BROWSER}               |
|open url        |http://localhost:${FITNESSE_PORT}/files/        |
|$element=       |find element          |class name:sidebar       |
|#now we push the webdriver and use the element as the table actor|
|push fixture                                                     |
|start           |$element                                        |
|reject          |has element           |class name:sidebar       |
|$subElement=    |find element          |tag name:a               |
|#we do not push the $element, but simply use the subElement      |
|start           |$subElement                                     |
|check           |get text              |FrontPage                |
|pop fixture                                                      |
|#now we are back on the webdriver                                |
|check           |title                 |Files: files/            |
|ensure          |has element           |class name:sidebar       |
|reject          |has element           |class name:aaa           |

But it is much easier and more readable to use <SlimWebDriver's special ''use element'' method.

!|script        |slim web driver                               |
|open url       |http://localhost:${FITNESSE_PORT}/files/      |
|use element    |class name:sidebar                            |
|use element    |tag name:a                                    |
|#the a element itself has no sub elements a                   |
|reject         |has element             |tag name:a           |
|check          |get text                |FrontPage            |
|#methods that only exist on the web driver are still available|
|check          |title                   |Files: files/        |
|use web driver                                                |
|#now we are back on the web driver sub elements a             |
|ensure         |has element             |tag name:a           |
