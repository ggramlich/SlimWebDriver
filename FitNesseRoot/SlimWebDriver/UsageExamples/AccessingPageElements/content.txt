The ${FILES_DIR_URL} page contains a div with css class sidebar which contains the anchor tag with text !-FrontPage-!

We can use the <WebDriver ''find element'' method and Slim's ''push fixture'' and ''pop fixture'' methods directly.
The ''By'' locators are written down like this:
'''method:selector value'''

Where method is one of
 * class name
 * css selector
 * id
 * link text
 * partial link text
 * name
 * tag name
 * xpath

!|script           |slim web driver      |${BROWSER}              |
|open url          |${FILES_DIR_URL}                              |
|$element=         |find element         |class name:sidebar      |
|#now we push the webdriver and use the element as the table actor|
|push fixture                                                     |
|start             |$element                                      |
|reject            |has element          |class name:sidebar      |
|$subElement=      |find element         |tag name:a              |
|#we do not push the $element, but simply use the subElement      |
|start             |$subElement                                   |
|check             |get text             |FrontPage               |
|pop fixture                                                      |
|#now we are back on the webdriver                                |
|check             |title                |Files: files/           |
|ensure            |has element          |class name:sidebar      |
|reject            |has element          |class name:aaa          |

But it is easier and more readable to use <SlimWebDriver's special ''use element'' and ''use inner element'' methods.
It also provides ''has inner element'' and ''number of inner elements''.

!|script               |slim web driver                                   |
|open url              |${FILES_DIR_URL}                                  |
|use element           |class name:sidebar                                |
|#the ''inner'' methods now find elements within the element just selected|
|ensure                |has inner element           |tag name:a           |
|check                 |number of inner elements    |tag name:a     |1    |
|#now we use the a element                                                |
|use inner element     |tag name:a                                        |
|#the a element itself has no sub elements a                              |
|check                 |get text                    |FrontPage            |
|reject                |has inner element           |tag name:a           |
|#the web driver's methods are alway available                            |
|check                 |title                       |Files: files/        |
|#now using the web driver to find the a sub elements on the whole page   |
|ensure                |has element                 |tag name:a           |
