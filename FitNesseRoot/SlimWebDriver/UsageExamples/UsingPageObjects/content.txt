<SlimWebDriver offers support for the page object pattern. You will have to write your own page objects, but <WebDriver's standard [[!-PageFactory-!][http://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/PageFactory]] is used to fill the element fields.

It is convenient to additionally have the web driver available as a library fixture, so that you can also use its methods (e.g. ''open url''):

|library                   |
|slim web driver|${BROWSER}|

|import     |
|pageobjects|

!|script                                                                                     |
|open url                         |${FITNESSE_STARTPAGE}                                     |
|#the following line switches the current table actor to the ''fitnesse startpage'' object   |
|start                            |FitNesse start page                                       |
|#the following line switches the current table actor to the ''files'' page object           |
|go to files page                                                                            |
|#the following line switches the current table actor to the ''delays with ajax'' page object|
|go to delays with ajax                                                                      |
|#now we can interact with the page                                                          |
|change title to                  |My new title                                              |
|check                            |get title                  |My new title                  |
